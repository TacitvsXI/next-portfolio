    text: "I'll introduce myself: my name is Bruno, I'm 43 years old, I'm Brazilian, resident in Brazil, more precisely in the city of Rio de Janeiro, in the Copacabana neighborhood. [8:27 PM]\n\nI started my way in the cryptocurrency market because I was disappointed with the financial returns obtained through traditional investments. Studying this market, I came across your twitter account. [8:42 PM]\n\nBasically, I invest my money to, in the future, cover my daughter's college expenses, as she intends to be a doctor and this course is very expensive in Brazil. [8:46 PM]\n\nAfter I started following your account, my income improved a lot. [8:51 PM]\n\nDue to your knowledge, today I have more hope that I will be able to pay for my daughter's education. And there is no word that can represent how grateful I am to you. [8:56 PM]\n\nI will repeat, your analysis is amazing. You are the only person on Twitter who does analytics with accurate dates. I can't imagine how you do this or how much knowledge you have to accumulate, but the result is impressive. [9:48 PM]\n\nSo I decided to do a survey of analysts who were on the internet (youtube, twitter, instagram, etc.). I surveyed the results of past analyses. The study was crude. Basically, I pasted the Twitter screens into a WORD file and then searched if the expected result had taken place and marked an OK, if yes, an X, if not a //, if it had been approximated. Did you get it? [9:50 PM]\n\nIn that rising, you were amazing. I think you are on the same level as PlanB. [9:54 PM]\n\nThe goals of your analysis are different. You focus on forecasting market ups and downs and he on studying the asset's ability to appreciate. [9:56 PM]\n\nYou are a genius. Although having money is not the most important thing in life (and it is not and never will be, have faith in it), you should have high goals and dreams. Think big. Humanity needs to find out who you are and what you can do. [9:58 PM]\n\nYou need to make a promise. And that promise will be yours alone and it will also be your secret. Every day you will ask the following to GOD: GOD, keep me humble. [10:01 PM]\n\nKeep yourself humble. Ever. This attitude will allow you to remain aware of changes in life and the world.",
